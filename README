eSports Event VODs
==================

Kodi Video Add On for eSports VODs listed on VOD subreddits like
[LoLeventVoDs](http://www.reddit.com/r/loleventvods).

Development
-----------

In a new virtualenv you will need:  
`pip install xbmcswift2 requests`

Use xbmcswift2 to test screens:  
`xbmcswift2 run crawl`  
`xbmcswift2 run interactive`  
`xbmcswift2 run PAGE_URL`

Eventually these will be run as unit tests.

For manual testing:  
```ln -s `pwd` ~/.kodi/addons```
